# tic_tac_toe
Text version of the popular game tic-tac-toe build in python
In this program - tic-tac-toe for 2 players 
I was exercising OOP principals like delegation.
Also, I was working on my error handling. I think the code is robust and "almost" impossible to break.
Happy coding everyone ! :-)
